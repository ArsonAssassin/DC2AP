# DC2AP

# Setup
Download the latest APWorld and Client (DC2AP.Zip) from the releases page.  
Double click on the APWorld to install it to your Archipelago installation (requires 0.5.0 or later)  
Run the Archipelago Launcher and click "Generate Template Options".  
A file explorer window will open with some .yaml files. Find Dark Cloud 2.yaml and copy it to your Archipelago/Players directory.  
Either run Generate.py or press the Generate button on the launcher to generate a seed.  
When this has completed, you will have a zip file in your Archipelago/Output folder.  
Host this zip either using the Host option on the launcher or by uploading it to Archipelago.gg  
Run PCSX2 version 1.6.0 (Yes, it must be this version) and run your Dark Cloud 2 ROM. (the Archipelago community can not provide this for you)  
With both the Archipelago server and PCSX2/Dark Cloud 2 running, Open the DC2AP folder you unzipped earlier and run DC2AP.exe.  
You should now be ready to start a new game and play.
